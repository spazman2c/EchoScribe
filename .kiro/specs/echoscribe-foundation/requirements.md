# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the foundational setup for EchoScribe, an AI-driven meeting analyzer. The foundation phase establishes the core development environment, project structure, and basic infrastructure needed to support the full application. This includes setting up the monorepo structure with React frontend, Node.js backend, Python AI services, and Supabase integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured monorepo development environment, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain the frontend, backend, and AI services components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a monorepo structure following the defined project organization
2. WHEN the frontend is setup THEN the system SHALL include React.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS configuration
3. WHEN the backend is setup THEN the system SHALL include Node.js with Express and TypeScript configuration
4. WHEN the AI services are setup THEN the system SHALL include Python with FastAPI configuration
5. WHEN all components are initialized THEN the system SHALL include proper package.json files with appropriate dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Supabase integration configured, so that I can use it for authentication, database, and file storage throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase is configured THEN the system SHALL include local development environment setup
2. WHEN Supabase is initialized THEN the system SHALL include database connection configuration
3. WHEN Supabase is setup THEN the system SHALL include authentication service configuration
4. WHEN Supabase is configured THEN the system SHALL include file storage configuration for audio files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want version control and CI/CD pipelines configured, so that I can maintain code quality and automate deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN version control is setup THEN the system SHALL include proper .gitignore files for each component
2. WHEN CI/CD is configured THEN the system SHALL include GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing
3. WHEN CI/CD is setup THEN the system SHALL include build and deployment workflows
4. WHEN version control is configured THEN the system SHALL include proper branch protection and code review processes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared TypeScript types and utilities, so that I can maintain consistency between frontend and backend components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shared types are created THEN the system SHALL include common interfaces for meetings, users, and transcriptions
2. WHEN shared utilities are setup THEN the system SHALL include common constants and helper functions
3. WHEN shared components are configured THEN the system SHALL allow importing from both frontend and backend
4. WHEN types are defined THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety across all components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment configuration and secrets management, so that I can securely manage API keys and configuration across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment configuration is setup THEN the system SHALL include .env files for each component
2. WHEN secrets management is configured THEN the system SHALL include secure handling of API keys
3. WHEN environment variables are defined THEN the system SHALL include development, staging, and production configurations
4. WHEN configuration is setup THEN the system SHALL include proper validation of required environment variables

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development scripts and commands configured, so that I can easily start, build, and test all components of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development scripts are setup THEN the system SHALL include commands to start all services locally
2. WHEN build scripts are configured THEN the system SHALL include commands to build for production
3. WHEN test scripts are setup THEN the system SHALL include commands to run tests across all components
4. WHEN scripts are configured THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and logging
